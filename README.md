# 100DaysOfJS
Every day for a hundred days, I posted simple JavaScript projects to my social media channels. Here, I will try simple JavaScript projects that will help me to learn more about JavaScript. 

100 Days of JS was an initiative that consisted of 100 uninterrupted days sharing content about JavaScript on my social media.

If you have any questions, ask me on my **[social media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vidushika-dasanayaka/)**
